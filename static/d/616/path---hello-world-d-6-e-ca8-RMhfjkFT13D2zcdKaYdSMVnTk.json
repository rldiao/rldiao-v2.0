{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Finally!!! My first blog post. After what seemed to be forever. I have finally got around to setting up the blogging workflow on my sight. </p>\n<p>I have learnt a lot about front end development by creating this site. Initially, I wanted to create a site as a project with no real intentions, but as I continued researching and looking into other people's sites, I slowly realised that there is a lot of value in creating one. </p>\n<p>My Goals for this site are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be an easy platform to learn about me and my work</li>\n<li>Blog my thoughts on everything from finding work and new tech</li>\n<li>Be a place for me to practice and learn more about coding</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Currently I think that there are many design flaws with the site in regards to maintainability. This will be a issue that I will have to slowly work on in the future.</p>\n<p>For anyone reading this, thank-you. I do highly encourage for any person working in tech to create a site of their own. Its a great conversation starter and just maybe it will land you your next job.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"February 14, 2019","path":"/hello-world","title":"My First Post:  Direction with this site"}}},"pageContext":{}}
