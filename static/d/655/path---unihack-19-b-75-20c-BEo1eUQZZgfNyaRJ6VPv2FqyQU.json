{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Today I'm here to talk about my fourth hackathon experience, Unihack 2019! </p>\n<h2>What are hackathons?</h2>\n<p>For those who have never heard or participated in a hackathon, they are competitions where teams are given a problem\nwhich they need to solve. It usually conducted over a 24-hour sprite, it is a challenging and\nrewarding experience. The problem is typically very general such as \"climate change\" or \"solve issue with this tech\"; sometimes they\nare specific problems which are generally given by the hosting company. Hackathons are a great way for students develop a sense of working\nwithin a team environment and the conflicts that can arise.</p>\n<h2>What is Unihack?</h2>\n<p>Unihack is a yearly hackathon that is hosted both in Sydney and Melbourne. It is known as the imagine hack as there is no topic, thus the participant can\nsolve any issue that they can dream of. The hackathon is hosted over 2 days and the competitors are given 24 hours to develop their solution. Unihack\nalso provides many mentors which can help with workflow, pitching or technology. </p>\n<h2>What did we do?</h2>\n<p>My team this year consisted of 5 members. After some ideation, we decided to work on the problem of personal safety. We developed a mobile app that\nsolved the issue of having to communicate many people that you got home safe. It worked by the user touching a button and sending\nall their loved ones that they added that they are safe. We imagined that it will be used mainly when going home and night, or\nas a way to check up on your elderly parents. We built upon this idea by introducing scheduling check-ups on people\nand live location sharing. We really focused the product on young party goers, parents and elderly. We developed the app on React Native (Expo)\nand used Firebase as our backend database. </p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Unihack 2019 was another great learning experience. Learning React Native (Expo) within the hackathon was very challenging. We faced many unfamiliar bugs and development challenges.\nHowever, I personally enjoyed the experience very much, and with graduation on the horizon, this is probably the last time I will be at Unihack as a competitor. Hopefully\nI can return to Unihack one day as a organiser or mentor.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"March 18, 2019","path":"/unihack19","title":"Unihack 2019"}}},"pageContext":{}}
