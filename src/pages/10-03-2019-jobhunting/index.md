Hello! I am back with my second blog post!


## Who am I again?


A bit of a self introduction for those of you who don't know. My name is Robert and I am a Computing and Software student at the University of Melbourne. I will be graduting in June 2019, so as of this post I am furiously looking for the next step in my career.


## What does a healthy mindset look like?


Job hunting is tough for everyone, but especially as a student. It's easy for use to feel we are inadequate or lacking when all see are rejections, but this is usually not the case. As someone who is currently in this position, I have found that we need to shift our understanding of success when hunting. Success isn't necessarily when we get that acceptance offer. It should be when we are achieving incremental goals that we are setting for ourselves; for example, when we can consistently get to the phone interview stage or on-site assessment. This way when we are achieving these incremental goals, we feel rewarded, and when we fail, we don't feel like we didn't achieve anything. 


## Why did I get rejected?


It isn't always your technical skills that get you rejected; keep in mind that your teamwork abilities, communication and likability are just as if not more important! Other times you're just different to the company's culture. Don't take it personally, you probably wouldn't have enjoyed the position anyway.

Remember to be well rested for your interviews and goodluck job hunting!
