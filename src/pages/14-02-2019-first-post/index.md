title: "My First Post And About The Site"

Finally!!! My first blog post. After what seemed to be forever. I have finally got around to setting up the blogging workflow on my sight. 

I have learnt a lot about front end development by creating this site. Initially, I wanted to create a site as a project with no real intentions, but as I continued researching and looking into other people's sites, I slowly realised that there is a lot of value in creating one. 

My Goals for this site are:
* Be an easy platform to learn about me and my work
* Blog my thoughts on everything from finding work and new tech
* Be a place for me to practice and learn more about coding

Currently I think that there are many design flaws with the site in regards to maintainability. This will be a issue that I will have to slowly work on in the future.

For anyone reading this, thank-you. I do highly encourage for any person working in tech to create a site of their own. Its a great conversation starter and just maybe it will land you your next job.
