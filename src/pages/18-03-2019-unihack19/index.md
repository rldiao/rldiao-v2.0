Today I'm here to talk about my fourth hackathon experience, Unihack 2019! 

## What are hackathons?

For those who have never heard or participated in a hackathon, they are competitions where teams are given a problem
which they need to solve. It usually conducted over a 24-hour sprite, it is a challenging and
rewarding experience. The problem is typically very general such as "climate change" or "solve issue with this tech"; sometimes they
are specific problems which are generally given by the hosting company. Hackathons are a great way for students develop a sense of working
within a team environment and the conflicts that can arise.

## What is Unihack?

Unihack is a yearly hackathon that is hosted both in Sydney and Melbourne. It is known as the imagine hack as there is no topic, thus the participant can
solve any issue that they can dream of. The hackathon is hosted over 2 days and the competitors are given 24 hours to develop their solution. Unihack
also provides many mentors which can help with workflow, pitching or technology. 

## What did we do?

My team this year consisted of 5 members. After some ideation, we decided to work on how to improve personal safety. It was decided that we will work on mobile app
application which would communicate your safety and status to friends and family. It worked by having the user touch a button and broadcasting a notificiation
to your selected group of recievers who would be notified of your safety. We imagined that it will be mainly used by people who feel unsafe when heading home from a late night
, or parents who would want to check up on their children's status. The idea was then built upon by introducing the ability to schedule check-ups 
and live location sharing. We really focused on the simplicity of use, and being as out of the users life as possible so they can focus on their lives.

## Conclusion

Unihack 2019 was another great learning experience. Learning React Native (Expo) within the 24 hours was very challenging. We faced many unfamiliar bugs and development challenges. 
However, I personally enjoyed the experience very much, and with graduation on the horizon, this is probably the last time that I will be able to attend Unihack as a competitor. Hopefully 
I can return to one day as a organiser or mentor.
